# CS111 & CS112 Coursework at Rutgers University

This repository contains coursework from the CS111 (Introduction to Computer Science) and CS112 (Data Structures) classes at Rutgers University. The projects are implemented in Java and cover a variety of foundational computer science concepts.

## Topics Covered

- Recursion
- Sorting algorithms (Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Hash Tables
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What I Learned

Through these projects, I gained a strong understanding of:
- Problem-solving with recursive logic
- Time and space complexity trade-offs
- How to implement and use core data structures from scratch
- Writing clean, modular Java code with OOP principles

## Notable Assignments

| Assignment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `RecursionProblems.java` | Practice with classic recursive problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and power sets |
| `MyBST.java` | Custom implementation of a Binary Search Tree with insert, delete, and traversal |
| `HashMapImplementation.java` | Hash table with separate chaining |
| `GraphTraversal.java` | Depth-first and breadth-first graph traversal |

## Technologies Used

- Java
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

## How to Run

All files are self-contained and can be run from the terminal or an IDE (like IntelliJ or VS Code). Just compile with:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
